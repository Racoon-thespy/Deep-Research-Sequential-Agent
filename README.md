# Deep-Research-Sequential-Agent

A Python-based multi-agent system for automated, deep research on companies (big and small). It scrapes the web (and other sources), validates datasets, compares with market standards, generates use cases, and outputs a detailed report with references.

## Features

* Multi-agent architecture:

  * **Research Agent**: Gathers data from Kaggle, Hugging Face, GitHub, and web sources.
  * **Analysis Agent**: Processes and structures collected data.
  * **Reporting Agent**: Produces summaries, insights, use-cases, comparisons with market standards.
* Automated web scraping and dataset validation.
* Configurable research depth (e.g. quick / standard / deep).
* Streamlit interface for interactive usage.
* Logging & monitoring of agent activities.
* Outputs detailed reports with references.

---

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have:

* Python 3.8 or higher
* API keys for any services used (e.g. OpenAI, Kaggle, HuggingFace, GitHub)
* A system where you can install dependencies

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Racoon-thespy/Deep-Research-Sequential-Agent.git
   cd Deep-Research-Sequential-Agent
   ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:

   On **Linux / macOS**:

   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

   On **Windows**:

   ```powershell
   python -m venv venv
   venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. (Optional) If thereâ€™s a `setup.py`, install as a package:

   ```bash
   pip install -e .
   ```

---

## Usage

* To run the demo:

  ```bash
  python run_demo.py
  ```

* To launch the interactive Streamlit interface:

  ```bash
  streamlit run streamlit_app.py
  ```

* To run the core functionality (agents) via main agent orchestration:

  ```bash
  python main.py
  ```

## Agents & Workflow

1. **Input**: User gives company name, optional context, and desired depth of research.
2. **Research Agent**: Scrapes / fetches data from various sources, filters invalid data, captures datasets.
3. **Analysis Agent**: Analyzes the gathered data, finds patterns, compares with benchmarks.
4. **Reporting Agent**: Generates well-structured report, use-cases, references, maybe graphs, summary.
5. **Output**: Report stored in `outputs/`, possibly also viewable via the Streamlit UI.



---

## Configuration

You will likely need to set up:

* API keys (OpenAI, Kaggle, Hugging Face, GitHub, etc.)
* Any credentials or tokens required to fetch / scrape web data.
* Config-file or `.env` (if used) for specifying research depth, timeout, logging levels etc.

---

## Examples / Demo

* `run_demo.py` can be used to see an example of full workflow.
* The Streamlit app provides a UI to try out research tasks interactively.

---

## Output

* Reports (text / markdown / PDF?) with:

  * Summary of findings
  * Use-cases relevant to prompt
  * Comparisons with market standards
  * Reference list (URLs, dataset sources)
* Generated datasets / raw data (if configured) in `outputs/`
* Logs for tracing what agents did, what data was used etc.

---

## Contributing

If youâ€™d like to contribute, you could:

* Add or improve data sources (more repositories, APIs, external datasets)
* Improve scraping modules for reliability or coverage
* Enhance the analysis agent (better metrics, charts, comparatives)
* Improve the UI (Streamlit) to make it more user-friendly
* Add tests, CI setup

1. Fork the repo
2. Create a branch with your feature/fix
3. Open a pull request with description of changes
